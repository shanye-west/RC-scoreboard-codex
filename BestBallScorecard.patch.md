# BestBallScorecard Fixes for Individual Scores Not Showing on Refresh

This patch file contains all the necessary changes to fix the issue where individual scores disappear on page refresh in the Best Ball Scorecard component.

## Root Cause

The issue occurs because the component uses `sessionStorage` to prevent double-loading of scores, but this causes the scores to not be displayed when the page is refreshed, even though they are properly stored in the database.

## Changes to Make

Apply these changes to the `EnhancedMatchScorecard.tsx` file:

### 1. Remove sessionStorage check when loading scores

Find this code:
```javascript
// Load individual scores into state when they're fetched
useEffect(() => {
  // Only proceed if we have players and individual scores
  if (!Array.isArray(individualScores) || individualScores.length === 0 || 
      aviatorPlayersList.length === 0 || producerPlayersList.length === 0) {
    return;
  }
  
  console.log("Loading scores from best_ball_player_scores table:", individualScores.length, "scores found");
  
  // Prevent double-loading if scores are already in memory
  const scoreKey = `scores-${matchId}`;
  const scoresLoaded = sessionStorage.getItem(scoreKey);
  
  if (scoresLoaded === 'true') {
    console.log("Individual scores already loaded, skipping...");
    return;
  }
```

Replace with:
```javascript
// Load individual scores into state when they're fetched
useEffect(() => {
  // Only proceed if we have players and individual scores
  if (!Array.isArray(individualScores) || individualScores.length === 0 || 
      aviatorPlayersList.length === 0 || producerPlayersList.length === 0) {
    return;
  }
  
  console.log("Loading scores from best_ball_player_scores table:", individualScores.length, "scores found");
  
  // Always load scores regardless of session storage
  console.log("Loading and displaying scores from database...");
```

### 2. Remove sessionStorage item setting at the end of score loading

Find this code:
```javascript
// Mark as processed to prevent loading again
sessionStorage.setItem(scoreKey, 'true');
console.log("Scores loaded and marked as processed");
```

Replace with:
```javascript
console.log("Scores loaded successfully");
```

### 3. Remove sessionStorage check in handicap processing effect

Find this code:
```javascript
// Ensure handicap strokes are visible in the UI and team scores are calculated
useEffect(() => {
  if (isBestBall && playerHandicaps.length > 0 && holes.length > 0) {
    // Check if we've already processed handicaps for this match
    const handicapProcessedKey = `handicaps-processed-${matchId}`;
    if (sessionStorage.getItem(handicapProcessedKey) === 'true' && playerScores.size > 0) {
      return; // Skip processing if already done and we have data
    }
```

Replace with:
```javascript
// Ensure handicap strokes are visible in the UI and team scores are calculated
useEffect(() => {
  if (isBestBall && playerHandicaps.length > 0 && holes.length > 0) {
    // Check if we've already processed handicaps for this match
    const handicapProcessedKey = `handicaps-processed-${matchId}`;
    if (playerScores.size > 0) {
      return; // Skip processing if we already have data
    }
```

### 4. Remove sessionStorage item setting at the end of handicap processing

Find this code:
```javascript
// Mark as processed to avoid redundant processing
sessionStorage.setItem(handicapProcessedKey, 'true');
```

Replace with:
```javascript
// Don't mark as processed, let it recalculate on refresh
console.log("Handicap strokes calculated");
```

### 5. Remove sessionStorage check for handicap initialization

Find this code:
```javascript
// Track if we've already initialized handicaps to prevent duplicate processing
const handicapKey = `handicaps-${matchId}`;
const handicapsInitialized = sessionStorage.getItem(handicapKey);

if (handicapsInitialized === 'true') {
  console.log("Handicaps already initialized, skipping...");
  return;
}
```

Replace with:
```javascript
// Always initialize handicaps on refresh
console.log("Starting handicap initialization...");
```

### 6. Remove sessionStorage item setting at the end of handicap initialization

Find this code:
```javascript
// Mark handicaps as initialized
sessionStorage.setItem(handicapKey, 'true');
console.log("Handicap loading complete and marked as initialized");
```

Replace with:
```javascript
// Don't mark as initialized with sessionStorage to ensure recalculation on refresh
console.log("Handicap loading complete");
```

### 7. Remove check for fallback score loading

Find this code:
```javascript
// Check if we've already loaded fallback scores
const fallbackKey = `fallback-${matchId}`;
const fallbackLoaded = sessionStorage.getItem(fallbackKey);

if (fallbackLoaded === 'true') {
  console.log("Fallback already processed, skipping...");
  return;
}
```

Replace with:
```javascript
console.log("Processing fallback scores from player_scores table...");
```

### 8. Remove sessionStorage item setting at the end of fallback processing

Find this code:
```javascript
// Mark as processed
sessionStorage.setItem(fallbackKey, 'true');
console.log("Fallback scores loaded and marked as processed");
```

Replace with:
```javascript
// Don't mark as processed, let it reload on refresh
console.log("Fallback scores loaded");
```

By making these changes, the component will always load scores from the database on each page refresh, rather than being skipped due to sessionStorage flags.

## Important Note

It appears that the current `EnhancedMatchScorecard.tsx` file has some syntax errors, possibly a missing closing bracket or brace at some point in the code. You may need to fix these syntax errors separately before or after applying these changes.

A common error message is:
```
'return' outside of function. (1489:2)
```

This suggests that there might be a missing closing bracket somewhere before the final return statement of the component.

When editing the component, make sure all opening braces/brackets have corresponding closing ones, especially in useEffect and useMemo hooks.

### How to Find the Missing Bracket

To identify exactly where the syntax error is, you can try these approaches:

1. Use a text editor with bracket/parenthesis matching (like VSCode)
2. Temporarily comment out large sections of code to isolate where the issue occurs
3. Check all closing brackets for each useEffect, useMemo, or other function block
4. Add console.log statements at different points to see where execution stops
5. Try a manual bracket-counting process from the bottom of the file

Remember, you only need to make the changes described in this document to fix the score persistence issue. The syntax error is a separate issue that may need to be addressed independently.
